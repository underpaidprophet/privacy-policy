privacy policy for my apps

My apps do not collect any personal information or data of any kind.

I have not programmed these apps to collect any personally identifiable information. All data such as saves, etc., created by the you are stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
